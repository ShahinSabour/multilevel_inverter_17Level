## Abstract

This structure offers multiple features of the conventional multilevel structures. Moreover, regarding the provided output voltage levels, the proposed structure exploits a new quasi-resonant basic module which helps to diminish circuit cost and complexity using fewer power components. In the proposed structure, the balancing of capacitors voltages is achieved by series and parallel connection with the voltage source and without the need to employ a complicated control system. In order to obtain higher voltage levels at the inverter ac side, a developed H-bridge is used in which the basic module is extended horizontally in separate cells on either side. Through a quasiresonant inductor deployment in the basic module, current spikes of capacitors are filtered which overwhelms decreasing of capacitor value and also lengthening the capacitor lifetime besides decreasing electromagnetic interference.
